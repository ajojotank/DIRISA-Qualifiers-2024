# Employment Status and Regional Unemployment Prediction

This project is developed by the University of Witwatersrand Data Science team for the DIRISA competition 2024, under the qualifications framework set by the CSIR. The team focused on predicting employment status using neural networks and regional unemployment using Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. The project involved cleaning and analyzing two datasets: the general household survey and regional unemployment data for different countries.

## Brief Overview

### Data Cleaning and Visualization
- **Employment Predictor:** Cleaned and visualized data from the general household survey, resulting in `employment_status_data.csv`.
- **Regional Unemployment:** Processed and explored regional unemployment data, focusing on trends and patterns across different countries, resulting in `regional1.csv`

### Model Development
- **Employment Status Prediction:** Developed a neural network model to predict employment status based on cleaned survey data.
- **Regional Unemployment Prediction:** Utilized an SVR model to forecast unemployment rates across different regions based on historical data.

### Presentations
- Contains presentations detailing methodologies, results, and insights from the project, showcasing the team's approach and findings to stakeholders.

### Utilities
- Includes useful resources like `dictionary.txt` which contains definitions and descriptions used in the data analysis and modeling processes.
